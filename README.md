# Petonic update notes

## {2016-10-09 SUN 11:03} 

Took the main fork of ThermOS and made the following changes:

* Removing functionality for AC since I'm in Marin County.  Just need Heat.  
* Move to a different port(7001)
* Start up fullscreen Chromium browser on the display automagically, pointing to the correct port.

## Setup
### [`Check out the full setup instructions here`](https://mholgatem.github.io/ThermOS/setup)

This thermostat requires the use of a **DS18B20** temperature sensor. **An alternative sensor can be used, but the getIndoorTemp.py file will need to be modified to gather and return the correct data.** I may at some point add the option to use a DHT-22 (combo temp/humidity sensor); but this is adequate for now. 

### -DS18B20-
Your ***DATA*** line needs to be connected to your ***VDD/POWER*** line with a ***4.7K ohm resistor***<br>
Then do the following:<br>
***DATA* on gpio 4 (*physical pin 7*)<br>
*VDD/POWER* on 5v rail (*physical pin 2*)<br>
*GROUND* on any ground pin (*physical pin 6*)**

Next, enable the 1-wire interface.<br>
This can be done by adding the line<br>
**dtoverlay=w1-gpio**<br>
to **/boot/config.txt**<br>
     *-or-*<br>
by using an up-to-date **raspi-config** (Advanced Options -> 1-Wire)

Reboot and your temperature sensor is good to go.

### -SOFTWARE-
On a fresh Raspbian Jessie image (full or lite)<br>

```
cd ~  
git clone https://github.com/mholgatem/ThermOS  
cd ~/ThermOS  
sudo bash install.sh
```
On a computer or smartphone, ***navigate to the ip address of your raspberry pi to finish setup***.
